# README File for the Invitag Museum Quizz

## Project Description
This is a html application that will display an Invitag Museum Quiz and displays the score according to the correct grouping given by the User

## Programming Language Requirements

Use the latest version of :- HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

## Server Setup

To serve some of the static files, we will have to use Node.js to create a server.

To do that, first download the latest version of Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then in command prompt type the following command:

* ```npm install http-server -g```

Now to navigate to the directory that holds the code for the application, type the command:

* ```cd (file path for the directory)```

for example: cd C:\Reuben\QCRI\QCRI Winter 2020\Invitag Museum Quiz

Finally, to launch the server, type the command:

* ```http-server .```

Your prompt must look like this

Open the URL at which the application is being served.

In this case: [http://192.168.56.1:8080](http://192.168.56.1:8080/)

The index.html file should open automatically.
